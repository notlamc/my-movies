# My Movies

My Movies is a simple React app that aims to demonstrate some of the technologies I am currently using in other projects. It's not pretty but it is functional.

The aim of My Movies is to be able to play with new things I want to try out and test their functionality.

It's handy to have a 'playground'.

## Tech

In this project, so far, I've used the following technologies to demonstrate their usage:

- Node.js;
- React;
- React Redux;
- Styled Components;
- React Router and;
- React Helmet.

I've also used some react hooks (such as useEffect and useState) and also some hooks from React Redux (such as useSelector and useDispatch).

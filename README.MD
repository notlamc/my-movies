# My Movies

My Movies is a simple React app that aims to demonstrate some of the technologies I am currently using in other projects. It's not pretty but it is functional.

The aim of My Movies is to be able to play with new things I want to try out and test their functionality.

It's handy to have a 'playground'.

## Tech

In this project, so far, I've used the following technologies to demonstrate their usage:

- Node.js;
- React (I've used functional components rather than class based components);
- React Redux (app wide state management);
- Styled Components (I'm done with Stylus, inline CSS and variants thereof);
- React Router Dom (to be able to differentiate between the pages of the app);

I've used some react hooks, such as useEffect, useState and some hooks from react-redux, such as useSelector and useDispatch. I used useState for component level state.
